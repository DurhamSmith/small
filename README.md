* Adding of parents/children
* Writing of multiple DNA objects or one object with many children
* Storing of COs that combine N conceptual objects, N > 1, e.g. linking sub-origami structures.
** Moving objects and their subobjects
*** Creation of new (sub) objs
 E.g.maving positioned to sub-origami elements and creating a parental container to hold them if staples need to be added they need to be added from the view of things being rotated/translated first (to bridge new coords). But if we are stitching something together that is 
*** Positioning of structural children on creation 
*** ? Joining sub objs on creation
* Model for single strand linkers (and ones in close proximity)





* In field

** Make partner when there are already some ocupied nts


* TODO Check that when making staple we make them in the correct 5->3
